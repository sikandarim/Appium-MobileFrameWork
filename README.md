# Appium-MobileFrameWork
================================================================================== BDD Cucumber Selenium Webdriver Appium Rest-Assured Java Test Automation Framework
This project is a template test automation framework, which provides structured and standard way of creating automated test scripts for GUI, Mobile and API level tests across projects

This is a reusable automation framework that blends together Selenium WebDriver, Appium, Android Driver, XUItest and Cucumber JVM (incorporating Gherkin and the BDD 'Given, When Then' testing construct)


*Mobile Automation on Emulated and Physical Devices, for Native, Hybrid, and Web App
*Mobile Automation on Cloud using SauceLabs

The framework incorporates design principle of BDD (Behaviour driven development) which promotes writing acceptance tests by describing behaviour of application under test in simple english language from the perspective of its stakeholders. Having test written in Natural language helps the Project Team (Product Owners, Business Analysts, Development and QA team) to understand and track the requirements

Supports Custom Page Object model which represents the screens of AUT as a series of objects and encapsulates the fields represented by a page which ultimately avoids duplication and improves code maintainability and readability.

Sonar Continuous Code Quality Management: - conventions (Checkstyle), bad practices (PMD) and potential bugs (FindBugs).
